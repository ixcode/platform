This is a collection of java utilities that I use all the time, so I don't have to keep re-writing them.

I've got bored of the number of times I've written the same code.

They are probably going to be separated into modules, such that you can import just what you need.

So far there is:

core - low level building blocks
http - java web application server and client utilities focused on REST and hypermedia
